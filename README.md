# Capture-And-Analyze-Network-Traffic-Packets-Using-Wireshark

## Objective
The objective of this project is to capture and analyze network traffic to monitor packets transmitted to and from network-connected devices. Identify and investigate potential malicious activity by examining packet data and developing proficiency in navigating and interpreting captured packets.

This will be achieved by leveraging a proxy tool, such as Burp Suite, to intercept, inspect, and manipulate HTTP(S) requests and responses in real-time. The goal is to simulate attacks that manipulate data sent between the client and server, observe application behavior, and identify weaknesses that could be exploited by an attacker.

### Skills Learned
- Packet Capture and Analysis 
- Proficient in using network analysis tools (Wireshark) to capture and inspect packet-level data.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Gained an understanding of common network protocols (TCP, UDP, HTTP, DNS) and how to analyze them within packet data.
- Malware Detection - Learned techniques to identify indicators of compromise (IoCs) and potential malicious traffic over unsecured ports.
- Data Filtering and Extraction - Able to filter and extract specific data fields for extended detailed packet analysis.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used
- Burp Suite	Primary tool for intercepting, modifying, and analyzing HTTP/S traffic
- Target Scope: Allows you to define the boundaries of the testing scope and ensure only relevant URLs are intercepted.
- Burp Proxy: A proxy tool that allows for intercepting, modifying, and inspecting HTTP/S traffic between the browser and the web application. This helps in analyzing how the application behaves under different inputs and configurations.
